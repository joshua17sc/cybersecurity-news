## "Driving Accountability for Security Posture in the Digital Era: The Evolving Role of CISOs"
[Read more](https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-need-for-collective-cybersecurity-accountability)

The role of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) has evolved dramatically over the past decade, with increasing accountability for security posture. Recent regulations like the EUâ€™s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and new SEC rules have shifted accountability towards the board, but in reality, the burden often falls on the CISO. The challenge lies in spreading accountability throughout the organization, fostering a strong security culture, and providing practical training. By prioritizing governance, organizations can establish clearer lines of responsibility, enhance security posture, and reduce the risk of unwarranted blame on individuals like the CISO. Building a positive cybersecurity culture that encourages collective responsibility and proactive measures is key to improving overall security posture management. Embracing a fix-first mentality, taking an active approach to cybersecurity, and fostering a resilient and security-conscious organizational culture are essential for driving accountability for security posture across the organization.
