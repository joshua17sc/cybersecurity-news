## "TotalRecall: Microsoft's Windows AI Tool Exposes User Data to Cybersecurity Threats"
[Read more](https://www.wired.com/story/total-recall-windows-recall-ai/)

Microsoft's new Windows AI tool, Recall, captures screenshots of user activity every five seconds, saving them on the device. However, security researchers have demonstrated that the data is stored in an unencrypted database, making it vulnerable to attackers. A cybersecurity strategist has released a tool called TotalRecall that can automatically extract and display all the information stored by Recall on a Windows laptop. This tool can potentially expose sensitive information, including messages from encrypted apps like Signal and WhatsApp, as well as website visits and text displayed on the PC. Despite Microsoft's claims that Recall does not send data to its servers, security researchers have been able to extract passwords from the tool. The Information Commissioner's Office in the UK has requested more details about Recall and its privacy implications.

## "Security Expert Warns of Potential Cybersecurity Threats Posed by Microsoft's Copilot+ Recall Feature"
[Read more](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/windows-11-recall-feature-disaster/)

Microsoft has announced the upcoming launch of Copilot+ Windows PCs with integrated AI hardware and software, including a feature called Recall that takes regular snapshots of PC content to help users find anything they've seen or done on their machine. However, security expert Kevin Beaumont has raised concerns that Recall could be exploited by hackers as an "infostealer" that empowers cybercriminals to scrape all data a user has viewed. Despite Microsoft's claims that Recall information cannot be exfiltrated remotely and that snapshots are locally stored and analyzed on-device, Beaumont has found ways to automate the extraction of the Recall database. This could potentially lead to "AI powered super breaches" and compromise sensitive information such as text messages, passwords, user interactions, and websites visited. Beaumont recommends that Microsoft pull the feature for now until security issues are addressed.
