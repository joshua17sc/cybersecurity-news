## 80 percent of organizations not ready for CISA rules on security practices
[Read more](https://betanews.com/2024/06/05/80-percent-of-organizations-not-ready-for-cisa-rules-on-security-practices/)

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's (CISA) Secure Software Development Attestation Form rules are set to be enforced on June 11, 2024, requiring software producers working with the US government to adhere to key security practices. However, new research from Lineaje has found that 80 percent of companies are not prepared for this. The study also reveals that 84 percent of respondents' companies have not implemented software bills of materials (SBOMs) into their development process, despite it being made mandatory by Executive Order 14028 in May 2021. This lack of compliance and awareness demonstrates the disconnect between government efforts and real-world action in preventing cyber infiltration. It is critical for software vendors and cybersecurity professionals to educate themselves and take action to protect their organizations and enhance the nation's cybersecurity posture. The survey also shows that a majority of companies use open-source components in their software, but only a small percentage consider them secure. While some claim to have tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, many are unsure or lack these tools. It is essential for companies to invest in tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities in both open-source and internally-built software.
