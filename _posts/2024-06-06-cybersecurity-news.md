[Read more](https://betanews.com/2024/06/05/80-percent-of-organizations-not-ready-for-cisa-rules-on-security-practices/)

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's (CISA) Secure Software Development Attestation Form rules will come into force on June 11, 2024, requiring software producers working with the US government to adhere to key security practices.
