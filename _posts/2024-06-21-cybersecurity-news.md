[Read more](https://www.wired.com/story/us-bans-kaspersky-software/)

The Biden administration has officially banned Russian cybersecurity software firm Kaspersky from selling new products to US-based customers, citing national security concerns due to potential ties to the Russian government. Existing customers will only receive software updates until September 29. American companies using Kaspersky software may face challenges in blocking malware without up-to-date antivirus definitions. The Commerce Department is working with other agencies to help organizations transition to alternative software and ensure a smooth shift away from Kaspersky. The ban is based on powers granted to the Commerce Department in 2019 by former President Donald Trump, and the decision follows years of warnings from the US intelligence community about Kaspersky's potential national security risks.

The article discusses the increasing number of breaches of health care data and the reasons behind them. Hospitals are attractive targets for cybercriminals due to the high resale value of stolen health information. Ransomware attacks on health care organizations can have serious consequences, impacting patient care and leading to lawsuits and public backlash. Healthcare data breaches put more sensitive information at risk compared to other breaches, potentially allowing cybercriminals to open credit cards in the victim's name or file false claims to Medicare. It is important for individuals to take steps to protect themselves after a breach, such as freezing credit, monitoring financial accounts, and being vigilant for signs of identity theft or insurance fraud. Taking precautions like using two-factor authentication and password managers can also help enhance security.

Cybersecurity researchers have identified a new evasive malware loader called SquidLoader that is spread through phishing campaigns targeting Chinese organizations. The malware is designed to evade detection by employing various evasion techniques, including encrypted code segments, pointless code, and Control Flow Graph obfuscation. SquidLoader is used to fetch second-stage shellcode payloads from a remote server, such as Cobalt Strike, and is popular among threat actors in the criminal underground for delivering additional payloads while bypassing antivirus defenses. Other loader malware, such as Taurus Loader and PikaBot, have also been actively developed and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and mitigate. Additionally, infrastructure related to the Latrodectus loader malware has been taken offline following a law enforcement operation called Operation Endgame, dismantling over 100 botnet servers associated with various malware strains.
